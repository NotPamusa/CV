# CV

User persona:
I chose to do this CV about a 20-something year old man who has studied Computer Science and is looking for a job in the IT world. Their skills and projects resemble my own since I did not want to come up with imaginary ones.


Information Architecture:
I organized the page in a way to make it easy for guests to find what they're looking for. Starting with the Side Navigation Bar, I included icons that link to my social media profiles, which stay on the left side of the screen for quick access. Next is the Header section, where I introduce myself and give a brief background. This part is centered and is meant to give visitors a quick feel for who I am. The Skills section follows, where each skill has a percentage bar to visually show my level of expertise in various areas. It’s a simple, effective way to communicate what I'm good at. Then, in the Studies section, I listed my educational background in a clear order, making it easy to see my progression over the years. Finally, I created a Projects section to showcase specific examples of my work, with each project including a short description of what it involved. Overall, I kept the structure straightforward to keep people engaged without overloading them with information.

Visual Design:
I chose a minimalist style to keep things clean and easy to read. I went with mostly neutral colors like gray, white, and dark gray, with blue highlights for a few elements, like the skill bars and social media icons—to help them stand out without overwhelming the rest of the page. The side navigation bar on the left has simple, monochrome icons that turn blue on mouse hover, adding a nice interactive touch. For the Header, I included a profile picture of an elegant man in a suit, to show that I take my job seriously. The Skills section has extended blue bars next to each skill name, where the bar length represents my proficiency level. Each section, like Studies and Projects, has some space around it to avoid clutter and improve readability. I kept the font simple with a sans-serif style, which is easy on the eyes and fits well with the overall clean look. My goal was to guide visitors smoothly through the page without any distractions, focusing on delivering my information clearly.
